# Dead-Internet
So we all know the classic [Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory), and if you're reading this I assume you at least know what an LLM is. Need I say much more? Yeah of course!

This is a little project I threw together in a couple hours that lets you surf a completely fake web! You run a search query in the only non-generated page `/` and it generates a search results page with fake links that lead to fake websites that lead to more fake websites!
It's not perfect, not by a long shot, but it works well enough for me to spend like an hour just going through it and laughing at what it makes.

If you encounter any issues with the search results page, reload and it'll generate a new page. If you get any issues with the other generated pages then try make slight adjustments to the URL to get a different page, right now there isn't yet a way to regenerate a page.

Also when you navigate to the `/_export` path or kill the server, the JSON of your current internet will be saved to the file `internet.json` in the root of the project. Right now you can't load it back yet but maybe I'll add that in the future if I want, or you could fork it and add it yourself the code isn't very complicated at all.

## How do I run this???
Simple, first install Ollama [here](https://ollama.com/download), then pull your model of choice. The one I used is [Llama 3 8B Instruct](https://ollama.com/library/llama3) which works really well and is very impressive for an 8B model.

Next you'll need to install Python if you don't already have it, I run Python 3.10.12 (came with my Linux Mint install), then the libraries you'll need are:
- [OpenAI](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)
- [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)

You can install them by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

You can modify the API URL and API key in the `.env` file.

Once those are installed, simply run the main.py file and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 or whatever URL Flask gives you and have fun!

## Image Support

Optional image support is implemented using the [SearXNG](https://docs.searxng.org/) search engine. To enable it, set the `ENABLE_IMAGES` environment variable to `true` and provide a URL in the `SEARXNG_URL` environment variable to your SearXNG instance. This does require you to have the JSON format enabled in your `settings.yml`, which is not by default.

## Inspiration
I'll admit it, I'm not the most creative person. I got this idea from [this reddit comment on r/localllama](https://new.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1c6ejb8/comment/l02eeqx/), so thank you very much commenter!
